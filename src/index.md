  <h1>StatCan WFA Dashboard</h1>
  <h2>Contribute to our collective knowledge</h2>
</div>

WFA has started at StatCan. Affected employees have each been given individual zone numbers, but management has refused to provide a clear explanation of how these zones were defined. These are decisions that may determine who loses their job, and we are expected to accept them without transparency and basic respect.

Since this information is being withheld, we have begun assembling zone-related information ourselves. What we are seeing is concerning and raises serious questions about the fairness, consistency, and legitimacy of the process. 
We need to work together to share what we know. Collective knowledge is how we protect each other. If you would like to contribute to our efforts to build a full picture of WFA at StatCan, please add your information here. 

This information will be used to build a database of everything we know about affected zones, which will be shared with you.

**Your name will NOT be attached to any of the information you share.**
